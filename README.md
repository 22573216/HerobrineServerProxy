# About
HerobrineProxy is a client proxy that allows a Minecraft client to be migrated between servers without the connection to the Minecraft client being interrupted.

HerobrineProxy is a module in the larger Koekepan project.  The Koekepan project is a software research platform for self-organising Massively Multi-user Virtual Environments (MMVEs). Current MMVEs are based on server/client architectures and this prevents MMVEs from scaling to millions of simultaneous users in a single contiguous virtual environment. Over the past 10 years peer-to-peer architectures have been proposed to solve the scalability problem of server/client architectures. Although a significant amount of research has been published regarding peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures for MMVEs, most of the research is based on computer simulations, thus limiting the adoption of peer-to-peer technology by industry. Industry has also been reluctant in adopting P2P MMVE approaches as a result of the loss of control that is associated with distributing the MMVE to the peers contributing resources to the hosting of the MMVE. MMVE research is moving towards hybrid architectures where a large portion of hosting the MMVE is offloaded onto cloud computing infrastructure. The cloud infrastructure has the benefit of distributing the load of hosting the MMVE, while still retaining the control of the cloud servers hosting the service. In a sense hosting a MMVE on the cloud can be regarded as hosting a P2P MMVE except that most the of servers hosting the MMVE is part of the cloud infrastructure. This simplifies the distribution of the MMVE and thus P2P MMVE research has already solved a number of issues that arise when moving MMVEs to cloud infrastructure.

The final goal of the Koekepan project is to demonstrate a goal of 10,000 or more simultaneous users participating in a single, contiguous virtual environment. Thus, the aims of the research platform is as follows:

* To allow researchers to easily develop and validate MMVE research using a real MMVE, rather than only relying on computer simulations. The research platform is currently being developed by extending a popular and easily available MMVE called Minecraft. 
* To develop a proof-of-concept architecture that allows for a MMVE with a single contiguous virtual environment. 
* To develop a cloud-based server-cluster test-bed upon which the MMVE research platform will be deployed. This includes the development of software capable of emulating 10 000 clients. 
* To provide a technology demonstrator to promote to industry the viability of hybrid peer-to-peer and server/client architectures for hosting MMVEs.
